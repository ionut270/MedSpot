# CC - 5

Homework 5 - Write a technical report that should contain the following documents:-   a case study that reports the proposed project to the international/national reality
-   technical details (architecture, technologies, marketing approaches) about existing solutions close to the one proposed by your team
-   overview of technologies you wish to use and motivate your choices
-   business canvas for the proposed solution
-   architectural diagram for the proposed solution
-   use-case diagrams for your project
-   APIs (should be done in respect to the OpenApi specifications, using Swagger Hub) & functionality flows documentation
# General idea
App to manage patients, to a clinic or to a multitude of clinics

__App divided into 2.__

### Patient app
- The app should have geolocation access to retrieve a map & a list of nearby medical cabinets.
- Sort & search on specializations & availability.
- If a place is crowded recommend the next nearest place of the same type.

### Medic / Admin app
- Should be able to approve / reject / move requests.
- Update data about that clinic & / or data about his specialization.
- Contact the client.

# Case study
In 2020 a pandemic hit the whole world, requiring people to do something called social distancing .
This arose the need of apps that can manage schedules & appointments more than ever.
This apps is meant to provide a general solution that can be used in a widespread domain to help different businesses & medical clinics manage their clients.

A general case study on the matter of social distancing can provide a better overview over the problem.

> As the spread of COVID19 in the US continues to grow, local and state
> officials face difficult decisions about when and how to transition to
> a “new normal.” The goal of this study is to project the number of
> COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for
> hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly,
> shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine for the State of Georgia. We
> developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection
> spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from
> Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation
> study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different
> social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or
> school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and
> voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels.
> The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels:
> the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and
> asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related
> demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results
> suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced
> peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K
> under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak
> from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from
> four to five weeks yielded 2–9% and 3–11% decrease in cumulative
> infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place
> duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily
> new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative
> infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from
> 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied
> across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place
> duration delayed the peak day by 6 days. Overall, shelter-in-place
> followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduced COVID19
> infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes.

Thus an app that will limit the waiting time of people in a que that will also reduce needless interactions between people is required.
